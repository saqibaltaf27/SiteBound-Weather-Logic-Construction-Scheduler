Project-Name: SiteBound: Weather-Logic Construction Scheduler

Goal: Build a web-based scheduling utility that integrates live Weather data to proactively flag "No-Go" construction days for Weather-sensitive activities such as concrete pouring, roofing, painting, and crane operations.

Requirements:
    1. Threshold configuration Engine
        - Users must be able to define weather-sensitive construction tasks.
        - Must Support at least four predefined tasks (concrete pouring, Roofing, Exterior Painting, Crane operations)
        - Each task must allow minimum temperature Threshold, maximum wind speed Threshold, precipitation tolerance
    2. Third Party Weather API Integration
        - Integrate with OpenWeatherMap API
        - Fetch 7-day hourly forecast
        - Use Environment variable for API Key.
    3. Conflict Detection Logic
        - Compare forecast data against task thresholds, mock project schedule
        - Must include unit tests validating Logic
    4. Project Dashboard (Web UI)
        - Display upcoming 7 days.
        - Color-coded cards per task.
        - Must show temperature, wind speed, rain indicator, risk level badge.
    5. Resilience & Error handling

Deliverables:
    1. Codebase: A ZIP file containing the complete, well-documented source code.
    2. Documentation: A README file explaining how to configure task thresholds, how to insert a personal API key, and how to run the application locally.
    3. Demonstration: A short screen recording (MP4 or link) showing the tool fetching data for a specific location and identifying a weather conflict for a scheduled task.
    4. Deployment: A link to a live demo hosted on a platform like Vercel, Netlify, or Render.
